_(As quoted in deliverable P1)_

The primary focus of this web-based application is to provide prospective restaurant customers the seat availability and wait times for restaurants of their choice. The customers can view all available tables, as well as wait times for such tables, based on restaurant type, table type (e.g. patio, bar, etc.), number of patrons, and other filters. They also have the option to submit a reservation for a particular table if need be.

On the restaurant side, the host stand manages all of its seating and reservations through the interface that illustrates the floor plan of the restaurant complete with every table and their respective number of seats. As the restaurant interacts with the app during service, the app will continuously draw all of the relevant data needed to perform wait time calculations and statistics which is displayed to the customers.

Some may begin thinking that SeatSeeker encapsulates all of the functionality that services like OpenTable and Bookenda already offer. The distinguishing feature of SeatSeeker is providing users with the ability to actively view the wait times of prospective restaurants through the use of statistical analysis on the average time customers spend at the restaurant and other factors. It is worth noting that while SeatSeeker is able to register reservations at participating restaurants, the main use case is to provide a convenient method for users to quickly view restaurant wait times for walk-in customers.
